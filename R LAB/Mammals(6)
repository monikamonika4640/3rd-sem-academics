a) Find the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. Are they similar?
pearson_corr <- cor(mammals$body, mammals$brain, method = "pearson")
cat("Pearson correlation coefficient:", pearson_corr, "\n")
spearman_corr <- cor(mammals$body, mammals$brain, method = "spearman")
cat("Spearman correlation coefficient:", spearman_corr, "\n")
b) Plot the data using the plot command.
  plot(mammals$body, mammals$brain, 
xlab = "Body Weight", ylab = "Brain Weight", 
 main = "Body Weight vs. Brain Weight")
c) Plot the logarithm (log) of each variable and see if that makes a difference.
 log_bodywt <- log(mammals$body)
 log_brainwt <- log(mammals$brain)
 # Plot the logarithm of each variable
 plot(log_bodywt, log_brainwt, 
 xlab = "Log Body Weight", ylab = "Log Brain Weight", 
 main = "Log Body Weight vs. Log Brain Weight")
