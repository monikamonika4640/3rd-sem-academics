# Load the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
a) What is the total number of observations and variables in the dataset? 
total_observations <- nrow(mtcars)
total_variables <- ncol(mtcars)
cat("Total number of observations:", total_observations, "\n")
 cat("Total number of variables:", total_variables, "\n\n")
b) Find the car with the largest hp and the least hp using suitable functions 
 car_max_hp <- mtcars[which.max(mtcars$hp), "hp"]
 car_min_hp <- mtcars[which.min(mtcars$hp), "hp"]
 cat("Car with the largest hp:", car_max_hp, "\n")
 cat("Car with the least hp:", car_min_hp, "\n\n")
c) Plot histogram / density for each variable and determine whether continuous variables are normally 
distributed or not. If not, what is their skewness? 
 par(mfrow=c(4, 3), mar=c(2, 2, 1, 1))
 for (i in 1:total_variables) {
 hist(mtcars[,i], main=names(mtcars)[i], col="skyblue", border="white", xlab="", ylab="", xlim=c(
min(mtcars[,i]), max(mtcars[,i])))
 lines(density(mtcars[,i]), col="red", lwd=2)
 }
d) What is the average difference of gross horse power(hp) between automobiles with 3 and 4 number 
of cylinders(cyl)? Also determine the difference in their standard deviations. 
 hp_diff_3_vs_4 <- mean(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 3, "hp"]) - mean(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, "hp"])
 sd_diff_3_vs_4 <- sd(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 3, "hp"]) - sd(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, "hp"])
 cat("Average difference of hp between 3 and 4 cylinders:", hp_diff_3_vs_4, "\n")
 cat("Difference in their standard deviations:", sd_diff_3_vs_4, "\n\n")
e) Which pair of variables has the highest Pearson correlation?
 cor_matrix <- cor(mtcars)
 cor_max <- which(cor_matrix == max(cor_matrix[upper.tri(cor_matrix)], na.rm = TRUE), arr.ind 
= TRUE)
 var1 <- rownames(cor_matrix)[cor_max[1,1]]
 var2 <- colnames(cor_matrix)[cor_max[1,2]]
 correlation <- cor_matrix[cor_max]
 cat("Pair of variables with the highest Pearson correlation:", var1, "and", var2, "\n")
 cat("Correlation coefficient:", correlation, "\n")
